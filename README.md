=====================

This is an alpha and not for production use.

## What is this?

A single package containing everything needed to start building a GOV.UK service. Once included in your project you’ll get standardised layout, styling and scripts.

## Why do I want to use this?

You’re building a service that will live on GOV.UK. This will give your service consistency with the rest of GOV.UK and give you access to our latest patterns and guidance. It will also make it easy to update your service to match changes to the core site.
